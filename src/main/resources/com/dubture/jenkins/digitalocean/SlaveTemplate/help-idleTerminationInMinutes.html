<div>
    Determines how long slaves can remain idle before being terminated - that
    is the droplet being destroyed.

    <P>
    Times are expressed in minutes, and a value of 0 indicates that idle slaves
    should never be terminated.

    <P>
    As Jenkins doesn't check the idle status of slaves every minute even if you
    tell it to (it might skip checks for a few minutes), Jenkins might
    terminate the slave a few minutes late of what you specify in this field.

    <P>
    Experimental: set to any negative value to destroy the droplet right before
    you get charged for the next hour. Keeping a droplet running for as long as
    possible (without gettting charged extra) is supposed to save money, as
    creating a droplet charges you for 1 hour automatically. Note that
    DigitalOcean charges for the second hour at 1 hour and 30 minutes, so the
    first hour is about 1 hour and 29 minutes long.
