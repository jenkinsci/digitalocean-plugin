    You can place the upward limit to the number of DigitalOcean droplets that
    Jenkins may launch for this particular Slave Template. A Slave Template
    is identified by "Unique name" field.
    This is useful for avoiding surprises in the billing statement.

    <P>
    For example, if this field is 3, Jenkins will only launch a new instance as
    long as total number of droplets associated with this Slave Template on DigitalOcean
    doesn't exceed this number. In this way, even in the worst case of Jenkins
    starting instances and forgetting about them, you have an upper bound in
    the number of instances tof this Slave Template hat are concurrently executed.

    <p>
    Set to 0 to remove the cap (why would you want that though?).
    Note that DigitalOcean appears to have its own instance cap at 5.
