    Always resolves the actually used image through its name. Usually images are either resolved through their slug
    or their unique id. The only reason to opt into resolution by name is when you recreate snapshots using the same
    name to force updates into the cloud nodes. If multiple images are present the newest is used.

    <p>This option may only be used with user images, not base images provided by DigitalOcean!</p>
