<div>
    For cost optimization with per-minute billing, you can enable one-shot mode by checking the "One-shot mode" checkbox in the Slave Template configuration. In this mode:
    <ul>
        <li>The agent is marked offline immediately to prevent new jobs from being assigned.</li>
        <li>The droplet is destroyed as soon as the current job completes and the agent becomes idle.</li>
        <li>This ensures each droplet runs exactly one job and terminates immediately afterward.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The idle status is checked every 60 seconds, so termination may occur up to 60 seconds after the job finishes.</p>
    <p>For faster termination when idle (without one-shot mode), set <code>idleTerminationInMinutes</code> to a negative value like -1. This terminates idle agents immediately, checked every 6 seconds.</p>
